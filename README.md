# VolunteerConnect

VolunteerConnect aims to streamline the volunteering experience for the public and provide an overview of volunteering data for administrators at Big At Heart. The website has two main interfaces, one for volunteers and one for administrators.

## For Volunteers

### Dashboard of each Individual’s Impact on the Community

* Volunteers can view their contributions to the community via the number of hours they have invested into volunteering at Big At Heart. A breakdown of the events they have participated in will be shown.
* Volunteers can view the upcoming events they have signed up for to keep track of and manage their commitments. Additionally, they may wish to explore other events that are available for volunteering.
* Volunteers can share their experience with the community via a blog. They can interact with and view other volunteers’ experiences at past events or make their own blog posts to reflect upon their journey.
* Volunteers can earn achievements recognizing their contributions to the community. These achievements will be shown on their profile page and they may wish to earn more by completing certain milestones.

### Volunteering Opportunities
* Volunteers can view and learn more about upcoming volunteering opportunities organized by Big At Heart.
* Volunteers can learn more about each event and sign up with their personal details. These details will be captured by the system and reflected in their individual dashboard under their upcoming events.

### Request for Certification
* Volunteers can request for certification of the number of hours they have volunteered with Big At Heart.
* Volunteers can request for a certification highlighting their participation in events they had participated in, as recorded in the system.

### Profile Page
* Volunteers can update their skill sets to be better matched to suitable volunteering opportunities on their profile page.
* Volunteers can edit their personal details anytime on the profile page during their volunteering journey.

## For Administrators

### Dashboard for Overall Administrative Matters
* Administrators can have a birds-eye view of their company information such as the total number of employees, average hours served, impact on organisations, total donations received, and their various projects.
* The sidebar provides quick access to various pages of the website.
* The notification button allows administrators to receive real-time updates from volunteers’ requests and remind them the upcoming projects.
* The “View Details” buttons allow administrators to click and view additional information.

### Event Calendar 
* Administrators can add/edit/delete events and projects to stay up-to-date with project schedules.
* It enables effective planning and coordination as everyone will be informed about upcoming activities and deadlines.

### Generate Reports
* Administrators can view the past years' annual reports by clicking the “Generate” button.
* Administrators can download Profit & Loss, Volunteer Attendance, and Organizations Impacts.

### Create New Projects
* Administrators can view the compiled list of projects by opening the “Projects” page and when necessary, they can edit the details of any projects. Clicking the “Add" button on the “Projects” page will lead the user to the “New Project” page, where administrators can create new projects.
* Clicking the “Save” button on the “New Project” page will save the user’s project draft so that managers can view it for approval. When they are ready to post the project, they can then click the “Publish” button.
* In the event they have to create forms to recruit volunteers, users can click on “Create Form” and an application form template page will open. There is a fixed set of questions, then users can click on “Add New Question” to add questions to customise for the specific volunteering event.

### Handle Sign-ups
* Every time there is a notification, the notification bell at the top-right of the homepage will turn red. Administrators can then click the notification bell, and it will lead the user to the “Notifications” page.
* Once administrators have read the notifications, administrators can click the “Delete” button or the “View” button to check the details. For example, if a user clicks the “View” button for a new volunteering form submitted notification, the page with a compiled list of responses will open. Administrators can also schedule interviews via the responses page.
